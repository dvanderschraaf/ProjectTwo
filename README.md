# project overview
"Calling on a friend" is a project based on the idea of community. It includes the lyrics of "Best Friend" by Brandy, where the lyrics take you on a journey along the pages through animations. 

# technical overview

This project is built using:
- HTML5 and CSS3
- Flexbox for layout
- CSS animations and keyframes
- Google Fonts for typography
- GitHub Pages for deployment
Animations were used to create smooth entrance effects, a typewriter-style intro, and hover-based interactions to make the website engaging to the viewer.

# acknowledgement
- Google Fonts for the font selection. 
- Inspired by design challenges and examples from CSS-Tricks and CodePen.
